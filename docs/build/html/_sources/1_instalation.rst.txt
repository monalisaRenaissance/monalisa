===========
Instalation
===========

Since the code of *Monalisa* is stored in a Github repository, you have to use git to install the toolbox on your computer. 
If you are used to git, you can skip the following two subsections and directliy go to the *Compilation* step. 
In the other case, just follow the two simple steps hereafter.    

Install Git
===========

----------
On Windows
----------

To install git on *Windows*, go to the `git page <https://git-scm.com/downloads/win>`_, download the installer and run it. 
Then open a terminal. You can run a *powershell* terminal or the *command prompt* terminal. 
Just search for one of those two by typing *powershell* or *command prompt* in the text zone in the start menu. 
In order to check it Git is installed correclty, type in your terminal

.. code-block:: powershell

    git -v

If the installation succeded you should see an answer like

.. code-block:: powershell

    git version 2.49.0.windows.1


----------
On Linux
----------

Write here for Linux.   



Clone the repository
====================

First create a folder on your computer were the toolbox will be downloaded. 
For example, name that folder *monalisaRenaissance*. 

Then open a terminal and go into the folder you just created. For me, this was 
done by running the command

.. code-block:: powershell

    cd C:\main\repos\monalisaRenaissance


We are going to clone the monalisa repository inside. For that, go 
to `monalisaRenaissance <https://github.com/monalisaRenaissance/monalisa>`_ and
Click on the green button ``<>Code`` and copy from there the URL of the repository. Go back to you terminal and type

.. code-block:: powershell

    git clone <the URL you just copied>

It should take a few seconds (or minutes if your connection is slow) but after that you should see the 
directory *monalisa* inside the directory you chose to clone it (for me *monalisaRenaissance*).
