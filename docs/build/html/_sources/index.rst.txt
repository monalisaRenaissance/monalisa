The Monalisa toolbox has been developed at CIBM-CHUV between 2018 and 2023 by Bastien Milani. It continued 
to evovled until now, notably by the contribution of Berk Can Açikgöz who contributed with 2D and 3D GRAPPA 
reconstructions while working in QIS lab at university hospital of Bern. 

Originally, the toolbox included mainly non-cartesian reconstructions that were implemented for 
the purpose of 3D-CINE cardiac MRI (4D and 5D). Iterative cartesian reconstructions were then implemented on the same 
model. Other conventional non-iterative reconstructions, such as gridded and simple "inverse Fourier" reconstruction, 
are also implemented.
