The Monalisa toolbox has been developed at CIBM-CHUV between 2018 and 2023. 
Bastien Milani originally developed the toolbox with non-cartesian reconstructions 
in the context of cardiac MRI. These are mostly iterative reconstruction with 
the exception of one gridded reconstruction. he implemented then iterative cartesian 
reconstructions on the same model that the non-iterative ones and Berk Can Açikgöz added GRAPPA 
reconstructions while working in QIS lab at university hospital of Bern.
